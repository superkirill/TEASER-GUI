This fork provides a simple GUI for the original TEASER++ project (without PCL dependencies), as well as instructions on how
to compile TEASER++ for Windows.

TEASER++ is a fast and certifiably-robust point cloud registration library written in C++, with Python and MATLAB bindings.

## About
![](doc/banner.png)
*Left: correspondences generated by [3DSmoothNet](https://github.com/zgojcic/3DSmoothNet) (green and red lines represent the inlier and outlier correspondences according to the ground truth respectively). Right: alignment estimated by TEASER++ (green dots represent inliers found by TEASER++).*

TEASER++ can solve the rigid body transformation problem between two point clouds in 3D. It performs well even if the input correspondences have an extremely large number of outliers. For a short conceptual introduction, check out our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xib1RSUoeeQ). For more information, please refer to our papers:

## Setup
### Windows

TEASER++ can be compiled on Windows using the MinGW GCC compiler (version 7.3.0 was tested and works). 

Requirements:
1. MinGW32 GCC == 7.3.0
2. CMake >= 3.10
3. Eigen3 >= 3.3
4. Boost >= 1.58 (optional but highly recommended)

```shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/superkirill/TEASER-GUI

# Configure and compile
cd TEASER-GUI
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=ON -DBUILD_TEASER_FPFH=OFF -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=OFF ..
mingw32-make.exe # Make sure it can be found in the PATH system variable
```

In order to compile a module used by the GUI:
```shell
cd GUI
mkcd build
cd build
cmake ..
mingw32-make.exe # Make sure it can be found in the PATH system variable
```

Copy libpmc.dll, libteaser.dll, libteaser_registration.dll or libtinyply.dll into TEASER-GUI/GUI, from 
TEASER-GUI/build/pmc-build, TEASER-GUI/build/teaser and TEASER-GUI/build/libtinyply.
